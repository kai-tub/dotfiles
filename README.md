# Dotfiles

This is my collection of dotfiles and scripts.
To run scripts located in `bin` the following
packages have to be installed:
- `git`
- `fzf`
- `bash`
- `curl`

## Fresh-install
1. `./install`
1. `cd ~` 
1. `bash bin/create_conda_envs.sh`
1. `bash bin/link_fish_here.sh`
1. `install_lab_extensions.sh` to desired environments
